Introduction
============

The VoronoiMeshMaker project is designed to generate Voronoi meshes for use in 2D and 3D geometries, primarily targeting finite volume methods.

This documentation provides an overview of the library, how to install it, and how to use its core components.

Main Features:
--------------
- Voronoi mesh generation for 2D and 3D.
- Extensible design for adding new shapes.
- Optimized for use with finite volume methods in computational simulations.

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the API Reference and Examples sections.
