Introduction
============

Welcome to the **VoronoiMeshMaker** documentation. This project is designed to create 2D and 3D Voronoi meshes for use in computational geometry, particularly in finite volume methods.

Key Features:
- Voronoi diagram generation for 2D and 3D geometries.
- Integration with CGAL and VTK for advanced geometric operations.
